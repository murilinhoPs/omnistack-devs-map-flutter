The idea of the project was to make a application to find near developers and filter the devs based on the technologies they use. The front-end in React was made to register the devs in your backend, and the mobile application to show a map with the devs. And the register part, from React, I'll create this feature in the mobile application too.

It's a good experience because rocketseat created the app in ReactNative and I created the same app in flutter, a technology I'm used to.
